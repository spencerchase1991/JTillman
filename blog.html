                    <div class="w3-container">
                        <p> The most important aspect of a construction project aside from hiring a licensed and insured
                            contractor is communication. The primary goal of every project is to assure the progression
                            flow is smooth and at the same time implementing specific details required by the client and
                            applicable building codes. In order to accomplish these goals communication lines need to be
                            open and consistently updated throughout the project.


                        <p> Communications tend to breakdown when general contractors, contractors and homeowners are
                            indecisive or don’t put forth the time and effort to make sure lines of communication are
                            kept current. This may be obvious to you but it can be a very difficult task for your
                            general contractor. Everyday during a project there are countless things that need your
                            general contractors attention; sitting down at the computer to generate current
                            communications isn’t their primary focus and typically the last thing that gets their
                            attention if ever.

                        <p> As a corporate practice we use the internet as a tool to communicate with our clients. We
                            call this presence our Client Portal. The client portal is a secure zone within our website
                            that requires a login and password to enter. This client portal has sections that include
                            all the information pertinent to a successful project. We incorporate accounting, permit
                            documents, communications, change orders, contract documents and streaming video. Not
                            everyone wants cameras mounted in there home but for those that work out of town or just
                            want to be able to see what is going on during the day when your at the office or in transit
                            its a great option.

                        <p> Currently available within our client portal.

                            <li><b>Schedule:</b>
                                <p> We post our evolving job schedules online making it available to all contractors as
                                    well as
                                    homeowners 24/7. Only the general contractor can update our schedules so if there is
                                    a
                                    breakdown in schedule updating there is only one person to ask why this is.</p>

                            <li><b>Communications:</b>
                                <p> Email communications is an ever favored mode of communication across the board. We
                                    take
                                    every email communication along with any attachments and upload them to our
                                    respective
                                    secure client portal for review and reference. Lets face it, we are all people
                                    subject to
                                    our memories and ability to recollect conversations accurately. Posting email
                                    communications
                                    avoids loss of email communications and makes them available 24/7 on virtually any
                                    device.
                                    We use email so much that in one case we actually found ourselves filling out a
                                    permit
                                    application for a job and realized we didn’t have the homeowners phone number
                                    because all
                                    communications were done either by email or in person and we never had a need to
                                    call and
                                    talk one on one about anything. This truly was an atypical situation but having
                                    every
                                    conversation in writing eliminates communication issues. There is never a he said
                                    she said
                                    situation when every word is in black and white.</p>

                            <li><b>Weekly Meeting:</b>
                                <p> Weekly meetings are a must to have a smooth project. Missing meetings or putting
                                    meetings
                                    off can cause delays or a complete halt in progress. Weekly meeting are critical but
                                    more
                                    critical is the documented meeting. We take the information developed during our
                                    meetings
                                    and create a detailed summary of each meeting. Minutes style detail of the meeting
                                    helps
                                    everyone stay focused in the same direction and have a common understanding. If any
                                    one
                                    forgets what was covered or exactly what decision was made, its available for
                                    review..</p>
                            </li>
                            
                            <li><b>Accounting:</b>
                                <p>  We post our job accounting for quick reference from anywhere. It is very important for
                                    clients to see what is going on with their finances. Its no different than having the
                                    ability to review your checkbook. If you can't see where you are right now you won’t know
                                    were you are going. Having an open book job accounting is very helpful and an option not
                                    many general contractors offer. We believe in this process because it keeps everyone up to
                                    date consistently.</p>
                            </li>

                            
                           

                            <li><b>Permit Documents:</b>
                                <p> We upload all documents involving the permit. You can look at your permit anytime from
                            anywhere and see the progression of your project as the inspector makes their visits. If an
                            inspector needs to see something corrected they generally will leave a correction notice.
                            Most correction notices float around a job site and eventually get lost. We post these
                            notices if we receive one so you can see first hand what the inspector wrote and what they
                            are looking for.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li><b>Change Orders:</b>
                            <p> Change orders are not something we want to see become a necessity but decisions are made
                            during construction that require one. Change orders don’t always mean the cost just went up.
                            We use change orders for all changes whether you are adding to or removing items from the
                            total scope of work we require a change order.
                            Change orders can be viewed and reviewed online 24/7. We have a link within the change order
                            section to download a blank change order or fill one out online.</p>

                            <li><b>Estimate:</b>
                                <p> The estimate we agree on letting us move forward and call a project a job is uploaded for
                            future reference and review including any attachments included within the estimate.</p></li>
                        </ul>

                       <p>We are always working toward making the project process easier and more user friendly. We
                        will be adding more online features to our client portal in the future.
                        The schedule, ever evolving as they may be are a necessary aspect of communications and not
                        only need to be updated consistently but available to everyone. An outdated schedule doesn’t
                        work for anyone and if a contractor doesn’t constantly update the schedule you might as well
                        not have one. The diligence of schedule keeping falls on the general contractor and can very
                        easily be considered a non critical item when attending to the daily intricacies of a
                        project. This may sound a little on the oxymoron side when mentioning the “attending to
                        daily intricacies of a project” but from moment to moment throughout a day in the life of a
                        project scheduling time to work on a schedule doesn’t seem quite as important as making sure
                        people are on site making progress, working together or running for that one material that
                        will keep the contractor working all day and not leaving early because they forgot
                        something.</p>

                      <p>When interviewing general contractors for your next project ask if they have a secure zone
                        or client portal where you can see the aspects of your project 24/7</p>

                        <h5>By: Lou Denigris <span class="w3-opacity">Thursday, March 12, 2015</span></h5>
                    </div>

                    <div class="w3-container">
                        <p>When you decide to build a house or an addition there is a lot to think about. Beside the
                            obvious considerations, site plan, architectural plans, fit and finish there is the most
                            important question; Who is going to be the builder?</p>

                        <p> We would like to work with every person that inquires about our services but that does not
                            always happen for one reason or another. That being said, the one reason we think we are
                            worth being considered as your builder is our competence and commitment.</p>

                        <p> First of all we love what we do. Generally, there is not a form of building we have not been
                            involved in, from new homes to additions, from large commercial steel buildings to
                            equestrian facilities of all kinds, and we are completely involved from beginning to the end
                            of the project. We do not use project managers, we personally visit and supervise the entire
                            project.</p>

                        <p> Our company does everything required to get a project up and running , from the architect
                            and engineer, to obtaining all permits through the final inspections.</p>

                        <p> The sub-contractors we use are all vetted licensed and insured. Beyond that we have worked
                            with these companies for many years. When you hire us you hire a team.</p>

                        <p> We believe in working with customer as closely as possible . We keep our clients informed at
                            all times as to the progress of the project and when any important decisions need to be
                            made. We encourage the customer to ask any question they may have, no matter how simple or
                            complicated. Clients are also welcome on the job site at all times. This is a joint venture
                            and cooperation between builder and client is critical.</p>

                        <p> We take our commitment to the project seriously , yet we try and make the entire process
                            enjoyable. This is not an adversarial situation, the goal for us and our customers are the
                            same. Make the job go as efficiently as possible, on time and on budget . If there are bumps
                            along the way, we smooth them out. We are easy to get along with and so are our
                            sub-contractors. It is our goal to make the entire process as pleasant as possible.</p>

                        <p> It’s simple really, keep the customer informed and involved as much as possible, so everyone
                            is on the same page and the project will be completed to everyone's expectations.</p>

                        <p>Thanks Lou and John.</p>
